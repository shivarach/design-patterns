Definition:
In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to
encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes
the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

Commander looks same as strategy. The difference is

* Strategy is meant for an algorithm i.e. a list can be passed to different sorting strategy implementations
* Command is an action that is done on a passed in object


Eg: Runnable command in thread pool with run action; Networking i.e. player actions in computer games
